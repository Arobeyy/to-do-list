- **Edit To-Do Titles**: Users can edit the title of their to-do list.
- **Delete To-Do Items**: Users can delete items from their to-do list.
- **Mark as Done**: Users can mark to-do items as done, which will strike through the text.
- **Persistent Storage**: The to-do list and its title are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist across page reloads.
